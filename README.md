## Optimizations for Large PRs

PR Genie uses several techniques to efficiently handle large pull requests:

- **File Prioritization**: Critical files (security, auth, config) and those with more changes are reviewed first
- **Smart Filtering**: Binary files, generated files, and overly large files are automatically skipped
- **File Limiting**: For very large PRs, only the most important files (up to 30) are reviewed
- **Parallel Processing**: Files are processed in parallel batches for maximum efficiency
- **Language-Based Grouping**: Files are grouped by language to ensure language-specific review

## Supported Languages

PR Genie includes built-in support for:

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Go

And provides default configurations for each language with appropriate file patterns and language-specific review criteria.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- GitHub Actions
- OpenAI API key

## Custom Review Standards

You can define your own review standards by creating a `.github/pr-genie-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "typescript": {
      "fileExtensions": ["ts", "tsx"],
      "maxFileSize": 1000000,
      "ignorePatterns": [
        { "pattern": "**/*.d.ts", "reason": "TypeScript declaration files" }
      ],
      "additionalChecks": ["Your custom TS standards here"],
      "customPrompt": "Your custom review prompt for TypeScript"
    }
  },
  "globalIgnorePatterns": [
    { "pattern": "**/dist/**", "reason": "Build output" }
  ],
  "defaultChecks": ["Your global standards"]
}
```
